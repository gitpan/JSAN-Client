=head1 NAME

JSAN::Index::Release - A JavaScript Archive Network (JSAN) Release

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides objects for a single release of a distribution by an author

=head1 METHODS

In addition to the general methods provided by L<ORLite>, it has the
following methods

=head2 id

The C<id> accessor returns the unique identifier for the release (an integer)

=head2 source

The C<source> access returns the root-relative path within a JSAN mirror
that the package can be found at.

=head2 distribution

The C<distribution> method returns the L<JSAN::Index::Distribution> for
the distribution that this release is of.

=head2 author

The C<author> method returns the L<JSAN::Index::Author> for the JSAN author
that uploaded the release.

=head2 version

The C<version> accessor returns the version of the release.

=head2 created

The C<created> accessor returns the time that the release was received and
first indexed by the JSAN upload server.

Returns an integer in unix epoch time.

=head2 created_string

The C<created_string> method returns the time that the release was recieved
and first indexed by the JSAN upload server.

Is equivalent to C<scalar localtime $object-E<gt>created>.

Returns a time as a localtime string.

=head2 doc

The C<doc> accessor returns the root-relative location of the documentation
for this release on the L<http://openjsan.org/> website.

=head2 meta

The C<meta> accessor returns the actual content of the C<META.yml> file that
came with the distribution.

=head2 meta_data

The C<meta_data> method loads and deserialises the META.yml content
contained in the index (and returned by the C<meta> method above).

=head2 checksum

The C<checksum> accessor returns the MD5 checksum for the release tarball.

=head2 latest

The C<latest> accessor returns a boolean flag indicating if the release is
the most recent release of the distribution.

=head2 requires

The C<requires> method finds the set of run-time library dependencies for
this release, as identified in the META.yml data contained in the index.

Returns a reference to a HASH where the key is the name of a library as
a string, and the value is the version for the dependency (or zero if the
dependency is not for a specific version).

=head2 requires_libraries

The C<requires_libraries> method returns a list of the C<JSAN::Index::Library>
dependencies as identified by the META.yml file for the release.

=head2 requires_releases

The C<requires_releases> method returns a list of the C<JSAN::Index::Release>
dependencies based on the dependencies specified in the META.yml file for the
release.

=head2 build_requires

The C<build_requires> method finds the set of build-time library
dependencies for this release, as identified in the META.yml data contained
in the index.

Returns a reference to a HASH where the key is the name of a library as
a string, and the value is the version for the dependency (or zero if the
dependency is not for a specific version).

=head2 build_requires_libraries

The C<build_requires_libraries> method returns a list of the build-time
C<JSAN::Index::Library> dependencies as identified by the META.yml file
for the release.

=head2 build_requires_releases

The C<requires_releases> method returns a list of the C<JSAN::Index::Release>
build-time depedencies based on those specified in the META.yml file for the
release.

=head2 file_path

The C<file_path> method returns the location on the local disk where
the release tarball should be, if mirrored.

=head2 mirror

The C<mirror> method fetches the tarball from your JSAN currently configured
JSAN mirror as determined by L<JSAN::Transport> (if not already cached).

Returns a file path to the tarball on the local machine, or may emit an
exception thrown by the underlying L<JSAN::Transport> functions.

=head2 file_mirrored

The C<file_mirrored> method checks to see if the release tarball has previously
been downloaded to the local mirror.

Returns true if the file exists in the local mirror, or false if not.

=head2 archive

The C<archive> method returns the release as an in-memory archive.
Depending on the type, this should be either a L<Archive::Tar> or an
L<Archive::Zip> object.

=head1 SUPPORT

Bugs should be reported via the CPAN bug tracker at

L<http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=JSAN-Client>

For other issues, contact the author.

=head1 NAME

JSAN::Index::Release - JSAN::Index class for the release table

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  TO BE COMPLETED

=head1 DESCRIPTION

TO BE COMPLETED

=head1 METHODS

=head2 select

  # Get all objects in list context
  my @list = JSAN::Index::Release->select;
  
  # Get a subset of objects in scalar context
  my $array_ref = JSAN::Index::Release->select(
      'where id > ? order by id',
      1000,
  );

The C<select> method executes a typical SQL C<SELECT> query on the
release table.

It takes an optional argument of a SQL phrase to be added after the
C<FROM release> section of the query, followed by variables
to be bound to the placeholders in the SQL phrase. Any SQL that is
compatible with SQLite can be used in the parameter.

Returns a list of B<JSAN::Index::Release> objects when called in list context, or a
reference to an C<ARRAY> of B<JSAN::Index::Release> objects when called in scalar
 context.

Throws an exception on error, typically directly from the L<DBI> layer.

=head2 count

  # How many objects are in the table
  my $rows = JSAN::Index::Release->count;
  
  # How many objects 
  my $small = JSAN::Index::Release->count(
      'where id > ?',
      1000,
  );

The C<count> method executes a C<SELECT COUNT(*)> query on the
release table.

It takes an optional argument of a SQL phrase to be added after the
C<FROM release> section of the query, followed by variables
to be bound to the placeholders in the SQL phrase. Any SQL that is
compatible with SQLite can be used in the parameter.

Returns the number of objects that match the condition.

Throws an exception on error, typically directly from the L<DBI> layer.

=head1 ACCESSORS

=head2 id

  if ( $object->id ) {
      print "Object has been inserted\n";
  } else {
      print "Object has not been inserted\n";
  }

Returns true, or throws an exception on error.


REMAINING ACCESSORS TO BE COMPLETED

=head1 SQL

The release table was originally created with the
following SQL command.

  CREATE TABLE release (
      id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
      distribution varchar (
          100
      )
      NOT NULL,

          100
      )
      NOT NULL,
      checksum varchar (
          100
      )
      NOT NULL,
      created varchar (
          100
      )
      NOT NULL,
      doc varchar (
          100
      )
      NOT NULL,
      meta text,
      latest int (
          11
      )
      NOT NULL,
